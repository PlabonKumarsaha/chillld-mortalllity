Repository description: 

The details of the paper are given in an additional source. All the machine learning, deep learning codes, and data sets are segregated properly. Each algorithm is implemented on a separate Jupyter notebook file. In the read me section of the repository, the data set description are given as well. The meaning of each column is briefed.
1. Dataset : CSV file to store the data
2. Deep learning.
3. Machine learning.
